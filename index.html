            <p>Mathematics is a fundamental subject that plays a crucial role in various aspects of life and education. However, for some students, learning mathematics can be a challenging
endeavor due to specific learning difficulties. Dyscalculia, a type of learning difficulty characterized by poor math performance, affects a significant portion of the student population. Extensive research has been conducted to understand the prevalence, characteristics, and types of Dyscalculia, as well as to develop effective interventions to support students with this learning disorder.


when we look from the perspective of Speech Dyscalculia, there are several apps that try to address the situation and came very close. the app called 'Socratic' is an app with AI integration and it can get a step-by-step guide for a mathematical question by uploading the question. the problem is that it's not specialized for small students. it tries to cover a huge age gap with the app. 
another app is 'MathTappers'. it is an app with a gamified approach to teaching math.  the problem is that app lacks a speech recognition system. this app is designed with user interfaces that are suitable for children. and there are using AI technologies to provide answers. 
'ModMath' is a math teaching application that's trying to teach lessons in an interactive way. Students can engage with the application and practice mathematical functions. but it does not have AI functionalities in the app to dynamically change the learning course. and it does not have UI preferable for the 7-10 age groups. 


In considering existing applications in Sri Lanka, The "Pubudu" app is a deep learning and machine learning-based mobile application developed to screen and intervene in dyslexia, dysgraphia, and dyscalculia, affecting around 10% of children worldwide. It supports local languages in Sri Lanka and follows clinical screening procedures recommended by health professionals. The app achieved high screening accuracies, such as 58% for dyslexia, 88% for letter dysgraphia, 99% for numeric dysgraphia, and 90\% for dyscalculia. Using gamified environments, "Pubudu" motivates and empowers underprivileged children in Sri Lanka to overcome their learning disabilities.
A Deep Learning Model to Predict Student Learning Outcomes was Developed in [2] The researchers conducted a study to explore how certain Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) based on student interactions with the Learning Management System (LMS) Blackboard could be used to predict student learning outcomes in higher education institutions. Blackboard is widely utilized in universities worldwide due to its capabilities in managing educational activities, content, interactions, and assessments.


Developmental dyscalculia is thought to be a specific impairment of mathematics ability[6]. Currently dominant cognitive neuroscience theories of developmental dyscalculia suggest that it originates from the impairment of the magnitude representation of the human brain, residing in the intraparietal sulcus, or from impaired connections between number symbols and the magnitude representation. The study sought out to extend our knowledge regarding the origin of mathematical learning disabilities (MLD) in children by testing different hypotheses in the same samples of children. Different aspects of cognitive functions and number processing were assessed in fifth- and sixth-graders (11–13 years old) with MLD and compared to controls. However, behavioral research offers several alternative theories for developmental dyscalculia and neuro-imaging also suggests that impairments in developmental dyscalculia may be linked to disruptions of other functions of the intraparietal sulcus than the magnitude representation. The MLD group displayed weaknesses with most aspects of number processing (e.g., subitizing, symbolic number comparison, number-line estimation) and two cognitive functions (e.g.,visual–spatial working memory).[7] These findings favor the defective approximate number system (ANS) hypothesis, but do not fit well with the access deficit hypothesis. Strikingly, the magnitude representation theory has never been explicitly contrasted with a range of alternatives in a systematic fashion. Here we have filled this gap by directly contrasting five alternative theories (magnitude representation, working memory, inhibition, attention and spatial processing) of developmental dyscalculia in 9–10-year-old primary school children. Participants were selected from a pool of 1004 children and took part in 16 tests and nine experiments. The dominant features of developmental dyscalculia are visuo-spatial working memory, visuo-spatial short-term memory and inhibitory function (interference suppression) impairment. We hypothesize that inhibition impairment is related to the disruption of central executive memory function. Support is also provided for the defective object-tracking system (OTS) hypothesis, the domain general cognitive deficit hypothesis and to some extent the defective numerosity-coding
hypothesis. Potential problems of visuo-spatial processing and attentional function in
developmental dyscalculia probably depend on short-term memory/working memory and
inhibition impairments. The magnitude representation theory of developmental dyscalculia was not supported. The study suggests that MLD might be caused by multiple deficits and not a single core deficit.


A recent study published in the journal "PLOS One" investigated the neural basis of dyscalculia in children. The study found that children with dyscalculia had abnormal connectivity between the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and the hippocampus. The IPS is involved in number processing, while the hippocampus is involved in memory. The authors suggest that the abnormal connectivity between these two areas may contribute to the difficulties that children with dyscalculia have with number memory. The study also found that children with dyscalculia had lower gray matter volume in the IPS and hippocampus. This suggests that the abnormalities in connectivity between these two areas may be due to structural changes in the brain.[4]
The study's findings provide new insights into the neural basis of dyscalculia. They suggest that dyscalculia is a complex disorder that is caused by both structural and functional abnormalities in the brain. The study's findings also have implications for the development of new treatments for dyscalculia. By targeting the areas of the brain that are involved in number processing and memory, it may be possible to improve the mathematical skills of children with dyscalculia.[4]

               <p>The mobile application or lesson delivery system for children with Dyscalculia should meet several functional requirements. Firstly, it should have the capability to collect and store data on the performance of these children. This data should include information about specific tasks or activities, the time spent on each task, and the child's level of accuracy.Fig.1 and Fig.2 show the activity diagram and system diagram for the system respectively. Fig.3 show the sample interfaces of the application.
From the mobile application that we designed, the children with speech Dyscalculia can select to learn the numbers from the application. the application is created with specially designed user interfaces for children who are in 7-10 age group. the recorded lessons of the app are created with the influence of professionals who are working with dyscalculia patients. the application gives learning tools to the child and gives a test to evaluate the student. basically, the application shows numbers and asks the children to speak the numbers. then the application listens to the voices and evaluates them with the speech recognition model to verify the answer. and calculate how much time they took to pronounce the numbers and how many attempts they took to get the number correct.

First, select level one, it provides a lesson on how to write the number zero after watching that video lesson then the user is asked to write the number zero. likewise, level one to nine numbers, and then the user was asked to write numbers from zero to nine with the guide. children have more freedom to use the given space. in the next five levels provide the image with the number of objects in the image and it should write the canvas.
All fifteen levels have three stars to achieve. If a percentage of 25\% is obtained, it achieves one star, If a percentage of 50\% is obtained, it achive two stars, and If a percentage greater than or equal 70\% is obtained, it achieves all three stars. only when each level archives at least two stars will the next level unlock. at the end of each level, the children's level is displayed then parents can get an idea about how their child improved.

To evaluate graphical dyscalculia children's following parameters are taken[3]; accuracy, and completion time. A pre-trained model is used to accurate the correctness of the number. This model makes use of the ANN-containing MNIST handwritten digits dataset[5]. The ANN consists of 19 layers, and 20 epochs were employed to achive its high accuracy of 98.3\%. After that, the numerical model was transformed into a Tensor Flow Lite file.
After the number writing task is finished, the handwriting is evaluated. A Random Forest Classifier is constructed using the parameters of average writing time, and success probabilities of written numbers. The model will forecast the likelihood that a child's ability to number write and improve.
In order to train the model, a total of 50 children, who have pre-diagnosed dyscalculia are used. The subjects include children between the ages of seven to ten who attend the "Ayathi" Training Center Ragama.

<p> <h3>The intervention of Visual-Spatial Memory Dyscalculia</h3>
Children can select a solving formulas game in the task list to improve their formula-solving ability. First, select level one, it provides a lesson on how to solve simple formulas after watching that video lesson then the user is asked to write the answer to the equation. likewise, level one to nine small equations, and then the user was asked
to write answers with the guide. Children have more freedom to use the given space. in the next five levels, the equations provide images and it should write answers in the canvas. All fifteen levels have three stars to achieve. If a percentage of 25% is obtained, it achieves one star, If a percentage of 50% is obtained, it achieve two stars, and If a percentage greater than or equal 70% is obtained, it achieves all three stars. only when each level archives at least two stars will the next level unlock. at the end of each level, the children’s level is displayed then parents can get an idea about how their child improved. To evaluate visual-spatial memory dyscalculia children’s following parameters are taken; accuracy, and completion time. A pre-trained model is used to accurate the correctness of the number. This model makes use of the ANN-containing MNIST handwritten digits dataset. The ANN consists of 19 layers, and 20 epochs
were employed to achieve its high accuracy of 97.6%. After that, the numerical model was transformed into a Tensor Flow Lite file. After the number writing task is finished, the handwriting is evaluated. A Random Forest Classifier is constructed using the parameters of average mathematical problem solving time, and success probabilities of written answers. The model will forecast the likelihood that a child’s ability to solve problems and improve. In order to train the model, a total of 50 children, who have pre-diagnosed dyscalculia are used. The subjects include children between the ages of seven to ten who attend the ”Ayathi” Training Center Ragama

<p> <h3>The intervention of  Memory verbal Dyscalculia</h3>

Among those games after the child selects number counting game there are several levels from 1 to 15 respectively, and for the first person entering this game, only level 01 will be displayed. After clicking level one, an introduction video will be displayed to the child to understand this game, and it is made in a way that small children can easily understand, then an interface will be displayed to the child to read the time respectively, then the time it takes to do it and the accuracy of telling the time. After consideration, the result document will be displayed and thus the level of the child can be viewed even by an adult, the result document will be displayed in the form of stars. All the result levels are in star form and it is classified as one star for 25%, two stars for 50%, three stars for more than 70% etc. In this game at least two stars are required to move from one level to next level. The following parameters are taken for evaluation of memory verbal dyscalculia children; Accuracy, and completion time. A pre-trained model is used to correct the accuracy of the time telling. This model Long Short term Memory Network
(LSTM) is used for the times told by children between seven to ten years old, After that, the numerical model was converted into a Tensor Flow Lite file. and The voice clip required for this voice clip training was obtained from students between the ages of seven to ten studying at de mazenod college in Kandana City, about five thousand voice clips telling the time in Sinhala language from 1.15AM to 1.14PM to Used for training the voice clips in that research.

			Specialists Frameworks are part of computer based intelligence, which were created by simulated intelligence local area in mid-1960. As referenced in [3], ES can characterize as "a keen PC program that utilizes information and surmising methodology to tackle issues that are adequately troublesome to require huge human ability for their answers". Simulated intelligence is comprises with gigantic scope of space in present day innovation and ML is a sub part of man-made intelligence, likewise with the assistance of NN or we called DL which is a sub part of ML, these frameworks can accomplish a capacity of doing in something in more brilliant way with less human cooperation. ES are utilized in many fields, for example, designing examination, environment determining, information addressing and learning, synthetic handling and clinical medicines. Utilizing these ML and NN advancements we can

Despite the growing interest in using image processing methods for identifying responses to mathematical tasks among students with Graphical Dyscalculia, there is a lack of research exploring the accuracy and effectiveness of this method in providing targeted instruction and feedback to these students. As a result, there is a need to investigate the potential benefits and limitations of using image processing methods for this population, as well as to explore ways in which this method can be integrated with existing teaching methods to create a more comprehensive approach to teaching mathematical skills to students with Graphical Dyscalculia.
